# Titanic-Machine-learning
Kaggle's Titanic competition , my analysis and attempt to predict survivals

__Data available__:
Train.csv contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.
The `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger 'no Survival ' column.

Data describtion is available on my attached notebook
Also the data files used, this proposal got me a 78% accuracy in Kaggle's Score.
definetely will try to improve that
